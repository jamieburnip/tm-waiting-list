## Notes

- The boiler plate I've used for this is from an old project that used styled components, if I didn't use styled components I would have used CSS modules.
- I didn't use TypeScript because the project wasn't set up originally like that so I was concerned it wasn't what you were looking for. Usually TS is my go to for React or Vue.
- Install with yarn then `yarn dev` to run.
